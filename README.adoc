=== Release workflow

When starting the work on a new version:

. Create a release draft on GitHub (tag name should be in the form of “v1.2.3” and release title can be anything).
. Update version in package.json (package version should be in the form of “1.2.3”).

After your final push, when you think this version is ready:

. Make sure all artifacts attached to the release are updated by push’s CI run.
+
If, say, Apple notarization servers are down or a build failed for a transient reason, then after this run
the release will have latest binary for Linux and Windows, but macOS binary will be left over from the previous build.
+
You can check build logs (look for “publishing” in Build/release step) to make sure all artifacts are up-to-date,
and if they aren’t due to a transient issue you can simply rerun the workflow.
. Change release status from to published.
. Repeat from the top.
