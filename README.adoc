== Development

=== Committing

This repository is set up with AngularJS commit message convention.
Pre-commit hook will invoke interactive prompt, powered by Commitizen,
that will ask you for information and put together a commit message for you.

To make sure you follow the convention:

* Only use ``git commit`` when making commits
* Don’t use built-in IDE commit prompts, since they may bypass prepare-commit-msg hook

=== Pulling

- It is recommended to use “rebase” behavior of pull (make sure to use fresh Git)
  by having this in your global .gitconfig:
+
[source]
----
[pull]
    rebase = true
----

- When pulling, Commitizen commit prompt may appear even if there is no merge commit to be made.
  You can dismiss it with Ctrl+C.

=== Pushing

There is a pre-push Git hook that compiles the app.
This helps us catch compilation errors before code reaches CI.

=== Releasing

CI builds the application automatically,
and attaches build artifacts to release tag that matches the version in package.json
if that release is still a draft.

==== Release sequence

When starting the work on a new version:

. Create a release draft on GitHub (tag name should be in the form of “v1.2.3” and release title can be anything).
. Update version in package.json (package version should be in the form of “1.2.3”).
. Push your commits as usual.

After your final push, when you think this version is ready:

. Wait until CI run completes, and artifacts for each platform are attached to release draft.
+
You may check build logs for each platform, looking for “publishing” in Build/release step,
to make sure all artifacts were indeed uploaded at the end.
+
If, for example, version in package.json during push did not match the draft release you want to publish,
then CI will silently skip attaching updated build artifacts to the draft, and binaries attached to the draft will be outdated.
. Perform QA/tests against artifacts attached to the draft. (Make sure that the artifacts attached are of correct versions, there are no regressions, and features work as intended.)
. If QA/tests succeeded, change release status from draft to published.
. Repeat from the top.
